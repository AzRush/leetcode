The problem is to find the max length of a substring contain no repeat charactor.
I used binary search at first because I found it easy to find a definate length of valid string linearly.
But the performance is not so good.
Then I found that if charactors repeated then the first should be abandoned.So the problem can be solved in a linear way.
